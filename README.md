# Data_Analysis_Customer_Data
The main aim of the project is to Develop input features. I have used two datasets the Visitor log data and User Data. The datasets can be downloaded from the link https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/job-a-thon-june-2021/download/train-file
Visitor Log Data – It is a browsing log data of all the visitors and the users. This table contains the following information:
WebClientID Unique ID of browser for every system. (If a visitor is using multiple browsers on a system like Chrome, Safari, then
there would be a different web clientid for each browser). The ID remains consistent unless the user clears their
cookie.
VisitDateTime Date and time of visit. There are two different formats for DateTime. 
One is in datetime format “2018-05-07 04:28:45.970”
Another one is in unix datetime format “1527051855673000000”
ProductID Unique ID of product browsed/ clicked by the visitor
UserID       Unique ID of the registered user. As expected, this is available for registered users only, not for all visitors. 
Activity Type of activity can be browsing (pageload) or clicking a product
