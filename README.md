# Data_Analysis_Customer_Data
The main aim of the project is to Develop input features. I have used two datasets the Visitor log data and User Data. The datasets can be downloaded from the link https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/job-a-thon-june-2021/download/train-file
Visitor Log Data â€“ It is a browsing log data of all the visitors and the users. This table contains the following information:

Now based on the above two tables, you need to create an input feature set for the Marketing Model.

Merging both the above datasets two create a userdatabase on the UserID column,
